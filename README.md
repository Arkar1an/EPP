# EPP
Exam in Programming Proficiency
## About
CSUF's two part, closed resource exam that must be passed in order to take upper level CS courses. Students were given detailed coding problems on paper. [Part 2](/part%202) of the exam students were given generic data structure resources which I did not write but I was allowed to use, to solve a much larger problem.

The exam was taken over 2 days, 3 hours for each day. Problems [1](prob1.cpp), [2](prob2.cpp), and [3](prob3.cpp) were administered on the first day and [Part 2](/part%202) was administered the second day.
